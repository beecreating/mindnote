# MindNote

A digital graph notebook for showing up without being watched.
No streaks, no rewards, no noise.
Just calendar, running tasks, and a goals “wall”.

## Concept
- Past months: Main + Goals
- Present month: Main + Goals
- Future months: Main only (light scaffolding)
- Notes live inside Main and Goals (no separate notes page)

## Tech
- Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- Offline-first storage: SQLite (expo-sqlite)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npx expo start
